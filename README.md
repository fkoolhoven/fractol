# About the Project

A project made in accordance with the fractol project which is part of the Codam Core Curriculum. This was my introduction into programming graphics.

# Getting Started

Start by cloning the repository:
```c
git clone https://github.com/fkoolhoven/fractol.git
```

Compile by using make:
```c
make
```

# Usage

To display the Mandelbrot fractal:
```c
./fractol mandelbrot
```
To display the Julia fractal:
```c
./fractol julia [real component of c] [imaginary component of c]
```
For example:
```c
./fractol julia -0.538 0.50695
```
- Zoom in and out with the mousewheel
- Adjust view using the arrow keys
- Quit the program with ESC or the window's close button
