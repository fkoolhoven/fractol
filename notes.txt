Fractol notes


to do:
- figure out coloring algorithm 
- include julia set
- connect right controls
- image size change with window



One pixel is 1 color
One color is 32 bits (4 bytes)
Bits per pixel = 32?
Buffer is a char pointer
Char = 8 bits!!!!
So to store an integers you need 4 char mem blocks!!!


linear interpolation

float to begin
take iteration
divide by max iter
multiply by amount of colors 255
end needs to be int because color value

original
A R G B
new
R G B A 


now 
FFFF0000 = BLUE
FF0000FF == RED
